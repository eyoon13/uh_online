<p>Cable courses are college courses you can take at home and receive college credit. The University of Hawai&#699;i system offers a number of cable courses <em>statewide</em> or <em>county only</em>.  Students may watch the class at the scheduled time or record the class lectures for viewing at a more convenient time. </p>

    <p><h2>Tips for Students Taking a Cable Course</h2>While cable courses are convenient, they do require time and willingness to study independently.</p>

    <p>Here are some tips that can help make you more successful as cable student:</p>

    <p><h3>Make sure that you have access to all of the written material from the professor as well as the textbook and broadcast schedule.</h3>Most instructors use Laulima to send or receive materials while some instructors may use other forms of online tool to support the class.  Contact your instructor if you are unable to access any class materials.</p>

    <p><h3>Be sure to attend on-campus sessions for orientation, labs, and examinations.</h3> Some <em>county only</em> cable courses may require a few on-campus sessions.  Be sure to check with your instructor or course syllabus for more information.
    </p>

    <p><h3>Develop a regular schedule for viewing programs and completing reading and special assignments.</h3>Cable courses allow students greater freedom of scheduling, but require more self-discipline than on-campus classes.  Keep up with assignments and viewing the broadcasts of your lessons weekly.  Stick to your schedule.  Do not fall behind.</p>  

    <p><h3>Treat each broadcast lesson as a class.</h3>Watch the program in an environment that is quiet, but not too comfortable.  If others are around, ask for their help by keeping interruptions to a minimum.  Remember you are studying a broadcast lesson and not passively watching a television show.  Actively draw out ideas from the lesson and apply these to your assignment and overall course.</p> 

    <p><h3>Keep note taking to a minimum while viewing the television programs.</h3>The broadcast lesson moves along quickly with so much information.  Do not take detailed notes.  By the time you have taken a note, you will be behind the information flowing at you.  Reading your study guide and textbook prior to watching the lesson will prepare you to catch the key points.</p> 

    <h3>Contact the professor by phone or email for assistance if you have difficulty understanding a unit of study.</h3>

    <p><h3>Review the broadcast lesson.</h3>A single viewing may be enough but often it is not. Many people find it extremely helpful to see a lesson two or three times to make sure they understand all the information.  Record the broadcast for later review.  Check with your instructor or syllabus about other options to review broadcast lessons.</p>  

    <p><h3>Access to a computer with Internet connection.</h3>Having a computer, with access to the Internet, and basic <a href="http://www.ctdlc.org/remediation/" target="_blank">online skills</a> are recommended.  Most instructors use some form of electronic communication with students outside of class meetings such as <a href="https://laulima.hawaii.edu/portal" target="_blank">Laulima</a> or electronic mail.  Students should check with their instructor, or course syllabus, for additional computer hardware and software requirements.</p>
