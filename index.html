        <h2>What is Distance Learning?</h2>
        <p>Distance learning provides students with access to education through a network of various technologies. Instructor and students interact at a distance without having to be physically present in the same location. Distance learning provides students greater flexibility in achieving their educational goals through audio, video, and computer technologies.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>
Students in multiple locations interact with the instructor and their fellow classmates using distance delivery methods such as cable, Interactive Video (ITV) and online.  Cable allows students to take courses in the convenience of their home using their television cable provider subscription.  ITV allows students to take a course from one location while the instructor teaches from another.   Online allows students to take a course using a personal computer or laptop.<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/dl/howdoesitwork"> More Information.</a></p>

        <h1>Is This for Me?</h1>
         <p>Distance Learning is not for everyone. Distance learning in many cases provides students greater flexibility. This flexibility includes freeing students from the constraints of travel or relocation, affording them opportunities to take courses otherwise non-accessible due to scheduling or physical constraints. As a result, students have more control over their own learning; successful completion will depend on the individual student's self-discipline and commitment to the course or program.</p><h2><button class="btn btn-danger" href="https://www.hawaii.edu/dl/selfassessmentquiz">Take The Assement Quiz!</button></h2>

        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p>Distance learning allows students to pursue a higher education anywhere at any time. However, many distance learning courses may not be accessible to students with disabilities. When planning and developing a distance learning course, faculty and instructional designers should take into consideration design guidelines for assuring accessibility for students with disabilities. Faculty may contact their campus Disability Service Provider for more information.</p>
