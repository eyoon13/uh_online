        <h2>What is Distance Learning?</h2>
        <p>The primary purpose of distance learning at the University of Hawaiʻi's ten campuses is to extend the University's rich array of quality instructional resources to students anywhere in the state who are committed to higher education but are constrained by diverse factors which prevent their participation as regular on-campus students at the University of Hawaiʻi campus offering their program of choice.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>Distance learning provides students with access to education through a network of various technologies. Instructor and students interact at a distance without having to be physically present in the same location. Distance learning provides students greater flexibility in achieving their educational goals through audio, video, and computer technologies.<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/dl/howdoesitwork"> More Information.</a></p>

        <h1>Is This for Me?</h1>
         <p>Distance Learning is not for everyone. Distance learning in many cases provides students greater flexibility. This flexibility includes freeing students from the constraints of travel or relocation, affording them opportunities to take courses otherwise non-accessible due to scheduling or physical constraints. As a result, students have more control over their own learning; successful completion will depend on the individual student's self-discipline and commitment to the course or program.</p><h2><form action="http://www.hawaii.edu/dl/selfassessmentquiz"><button class="btn btn-danger" type="submit">Take The Assement Quiz!</button></form></h2>
