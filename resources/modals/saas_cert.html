                Students will receive a strong theoretical foundation in substance use disorders and exposure to the knowledge, skills, and attitudes identified by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as the basis for effective treatment of substance-related problems. Completion of the Certificate satisfies current state education requirements for substance abuse counselors (note: the state education requirements may also be satisfied with other social science course work). State certification further requires fieldwork hours and a written and oral examination.</br></br>
