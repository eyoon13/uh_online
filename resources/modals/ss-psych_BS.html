                To meet the educational needs of students who reside on the neighbor islands, this baccalaureate program delivered through Distance Learning has been established as a transfer program for students who have completed the first two years of course work (freshman and sophomore) from a neighbor island community college in the UH system.  Students enrolled in this program will be assigned faculty advisors to help with academic planning.</br>Psychology is the study of mind and behavior. UH West OÊ»ahu offers a Bachelor of Arts in Social Sciences with a concentration in Psychology degree that integrates practical mental health applications with current theory. Students select courses from four clusters: Human Development; Social Psychology; Experimental Psychology; and Clinical and Applied Psychology. The program culminates with a final senior seminar capstone course that is designed to guide students in the research and writing of a review paper on a topic of psychology. Through these course offerings, students will gain a strong understanding of psychological theory and methodology, while developing effective analytical and interpersonal skills.</br></br>
