                The MEd-CS Literacy Specialist Concentration is offered as a partnership between the Curriculum Studies and Special Education Departments. The program prepares literacy specialists to ensure all students achieve their maximum potentials as readers, writers, listeners, speakers, and practitioners of 21st Century literacies (e.g., digital, media, visual, critical). The program addresses both International Reading Association Standards for Reading Professionals: Reading Specialist/Literacy Coaches (ILA) and International Dyslexia Association Knowledge and Practice Standards for Teachers of Reading (IDA). The Literacy Specialist program will be completely online, except for the orientation day during the first summer and a celebration day in the second summer. Students who are not on Oʻahu will receive up to $200 stipends to cover travel costs for both trips. Non-residents of Hawaiʻi may attend the celebration day online.</br></br>
