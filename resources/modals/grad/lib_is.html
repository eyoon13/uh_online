                The Library and Information Science Program educates individuals for careers as librarians and information specialists. The Program serves a diverse student population that represents the Hawaiʻi-Pacific area as well as national and international regions of the world. Students in the Program obtain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are fundamental to professional competence and career-long professional growth in library and information services. The Program's distance education program offers approximately 30 percent of its courses as either synchronous hybrid courses (via UH Hālāwai) or as asynchronous (via UH Laulima) to neighbor islands; at least two courses are available to distance students each fall and spring semester. Because of time-zone differences, the nature of hybrid courses, and staffing/resource limitations, the Program does not accept out-of-state applicants who wish to complete the MLISc degree program online.</br></br>
