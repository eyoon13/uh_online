                The Online Master's in Learning Design and Technology (OTEC) program welcomes busy professionals from the neighbor islands and the mainland United States as well as foreign students who hold a bachelor's degree and find time and distance constraints of furthering an on-campus degree too difficult. OTEC is a two-year academic program leading to a Master's in Education (M.Ed). Students are required to attend two campus-based, weekend sessions as part of the program. The first is an orientation scheduled as part of a three-day, on-campus retreat usually beginning on the Friday of the weekend proceeding the first day of instruction in August. The second is a two-day Saturday-Sunday session after the fifth or sixth week of classes. There are no on-campus sessions required after these two in the first semester.</br></br>
