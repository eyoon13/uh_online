                To meet the educational needs of students who reside on the neighbor islands, this baccalaureate program delivered through Distance Learning has been established as a transfer program for students who have completed the first two years of course work (freshman and sophomore) from a neighbor island community college in the UH system.  Students enrolled in this program will be assigned faculty advisors to help with academic planning.</br></br>The study of marketing involves analyzing processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners and society at large.
