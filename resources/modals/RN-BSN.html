                The University of Hawaiʻi at Hilo (UH Hilo), RN-BSN Program builds upon the Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) to provide a broader scope of practice that prepares the student for leadership and advancement in education. Courses are offered fully online, with the following exceptions: 1) Practice components in the program focus on community service and program development. Sites for practice experiences are located across the state of Hawaiʻi so students can partner with agencies in their own communities; these practice experiences are overseen by a site preceptor and a faculty member from the UH Hilo School of Nursing at the student's site. 2) A physical assessment course is arranged with the student at their site by a UH Hilo School of Nursing faculty member.</br></br>
