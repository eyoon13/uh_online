                To meet the educational needs of students who reside on the neighbor islands, this baccalaureate program delivered through Distance Learning has been established as a transfer program for students who have completed the first two years of course work (freshman and sophomore) from a neighbor island community college in the UH system.  Students enrolled in this program will be assigned faculty advisors to help with academic planning.</br>Early Childhood Education students will examine how parents and other family members work collaboratively with teachers to build a learning and home environment that stimulates curiosity through informal educational opportunities. The principles of quality education, multiculturalism, critical thinking, and reflective teaching are infused in all major coursework. The courses are designed to build a strong sense of social justice while also educating all students from diverse backgrounds and inspiring teachers as agents of change.</br></br>
