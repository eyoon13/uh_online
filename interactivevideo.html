 <h1>Interactive Video (ITV) Student Guide</h1>

<p>Interactive video (ITV) allows students to attend a course at a location other than the host campus (campus offering the course). Locations are predetermined by the offering department/college before registration. Students should check with the instructor on the site locations before they register to ensure the class is available to them.</p>
<p>Similar to a face-to-face course, students are required to attend class meetings on specific days and times (synchronous) at specified locations. ITV involves the use of large video monitors, microphones and special equipment to connect two or more sites. It supports audio, video and in some cases, document sharing.</p>
<p>Unlike a face-to-face course, you need to rely on technology to communicate in class. If this is your first experience in an ITV course it may take time to adjust. However, you will find that the technology becomes transparent during the length of the course.</p>

    <h2>Hawai&#699;i Interactive Video Service (HITS)</h2>
    <p>HITS is managed by ITS Academic Technologies and provides delivery of ITV classes for the University of Hawai&#699;i System, in collaboration with campus media centers and educational centers throughout the University of Hawai&#699;i System. HITS resides on a dedicated network and provides ITV classrooms with a High-Definition videoconference connection, especially designed for a telepresence learning experience. This gives the students the ability to simultaneously see documents and presentations, as well as, see and hear the instructor, students at other locations, and any other forms of media. Students taking an ITV class on HITS should refer to the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/dl/location/" target="_blank">HITS ITV Locations</a> webpage for location information and view the <a href="video_uh_telepresence_environment_orientation">HITS Student Orientation video</a>. ITV classes supported by other colleges, or academic department's video conferencing systems, may differ in the ability to see all students, documents, and/or media presentations at the same time.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Students Taking an ITV Course</h2>

    <p><h3>Take responsibility for your learning</h3>Participate in class discussion. Attend class regularly. Get to know your classmates at your location and exchange phone numbers. If you miss a class, ask your classmates, or instructor, to go over what you missed. Check your syllabus to see how to contact your instructor outside of class.</p>


    <p><h3>Be on time</h3> The start and end times of an ITV class session are pre-programmed. The class will always end at the scheduled time unless the instructor ends class early.</p>


    <p><h3>Sit Near a Microphone</h3> When speaking in class, face forward and talk normally. The microphones picks up audio well so it is not necessary to lean toward the microphone. The audio system in the classroom is not a public address system, so you will not hear your voice over the speakers in the classroom. Be sure to turn off your microphone as soon as you're done speaking. The microphone is sensitive and will pick up side conversations and other noises that may distract classmates at other locations from hearing the instructor. Be mindful not to set books, papers, or other articles over the microphone.</p>


    <p><h3>Sit in Camera View</h3> Find a seat in the ITV classroom that allows you to be seen on the monitor. Due to the set camera angle, the instructor may not be able to see you well enough to know that you have a question or are confused. Donâ€™t be afraid to sit in the front row. Be aware that you are visible to anyone at any of the other connected receive sites.</p>


    <p><h3>Be Assertive</h3>In an ITV classroom environment, when you are speaking, your audio will most likely be heard before the video of your location is switched to allow everyone to see you. Therefore, before you ask a question or make a comment, state your name, and your site location. For instance, "Dr. Liu, this is Jane Doe at Maui, I have a question." Let the instructor know if she or he is talking too fast, or if the type font of the graphic is too small or difficult to see. If you notice that your classmate at another location isn't using his or her microphone, please interrupt and kindly ask if he, or she, could turn on the microphone so you can hear them. If you experience any other problems with sound or picture, be sure to let your instructor and site technician know.</p>


    <p><h3>Turn off Cell Phones</h3> Please turn off your cellular phone in the ITV classroom. Cellular phones will create audio disturbances, even if they are on vibrate or mute.</p>


    <p><h3>Assignments</h3>Please refer to your course syllabus for assignments and instructor contact information. Distribution of materials is handled by your instructor. Materials for students located at sites other than the originating site, are either distributed electronically or through the U.S. Postal Service.</p>


    <p><h3>Plan ahead for student presentations</h3>Class presentations in an ITV environment require advance planning and coordination.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Some sites may have available instructional media (computers, DVD players, document cameras, etc.), while other sites may not. Make arrangements with your site technician, prior to your student presentation, for availability of instructional media, and to learn how to use the equipment.</li>
            <li>If you plan to provide handouts to your instructor and classmates, be sure to email them or post them on Laulima at least one day before your presentation. That way, your classmates will be able to print it out for the presentation. Always abide by copyright guidelines when using copyrighted materials for your presentation.</li>
        </ul>

    <p><h3>Access to a computer with Internet connection</h3>Having a computer, with access to the Internet, and basic online skills are recommended. Most instructors use some form of electronic communication with students outside of class meetings such as Laulima or electronic mail. Students should check with their instructor, or course syllabus, for additional computer hardware and software requirements.</p>
