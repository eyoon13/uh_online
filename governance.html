 <h1>Governance</h1>
                <p>The goal of distance learning at the University of Hawai&#699;i is to provide access to the rich array of instructional resources already available to on-campus students and to students anywhere in the state who are committed to higher education, but unable to attend the UH campus offering their program of choice. This is consistent with the goals of the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/ovppp/stratplansys.html" target="_blank">University of Hawai&#699;i Strategic Plan</a>. As part of the strategic planning process the <a href="/dl/docs/DLPlanUpdate.pdf" target="_blank">University of Hawai&#699;i Distance and Distributed Learning Action Plan (PDF)</a> was drafted to lay out the specific actions UH should take to move forward. In addition, UH endeavors to apply the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/dl/general/resources/GoodPracticesinDeD.pdf" target="_blank">Principles of Good Practice for Electronically Offered Degree Programs (PDF)</a>. More information about the structure of distance learning can be found in <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ep&policyChapter=5&policyNumber=204" target="_blank">Executive Policy EP 5.204, University Distance Learning Plans, Policies and Procedures</a> and <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/index.php?action=viewPolicy&policySection=rp&policyChapter=5&policyNumber=210&menuView=open" target="_blank">Regents Policy RP 5.210, Distance Education and Offsite Instruction</a>.</p>

                <h2>Systemwide Distance Learning Groups</h2>
                 
                <p><b>Distance Learning Advisory Council (DLAC)</b> is the lead system-wide group that helps the University of Hawai&#699;i advance its mission through distance and online learning.  The DLAC is responsible to recommend policies and to proactively identify and catalyze action on systemic issues as they arise.   As appropriate, the DLAC counsels University administrators and policy-makers through such groups as the Council of Chancellors, the Council of Chief Academic Officer, and the Council of Chief Student Affairs Officers.  The DLAC prepares, monitors and oversees a system-wide distance and online learning action plan that advances overall institutional plans and priorities of the UH system and the campuses (<a href="/dl/docs/DLPlanUpdate.pdf" target="_blank">DL Plan Update</a>).  The DLAC is convened and chaired jointly by the offices of the Vice President for Academic Policy and Planning and Vice President for Information Technology/Chief Information Officer.</p>

              <p><b>Distance Learning Program Planning Group (DLPPG)</b> is a system-wide group composed of University and Education Centers and representation from offering units that assists campuses, departments and support units in the planning and coordination of distance and online programs to meet educational needs within the State of Hawai&#699;i. The DLPPG advises programs, allocates system resources, and coordinates the master listings of distance and online programs. The DLPPG is convened and chaired by the Director of Academic Technologies.  </p>

                <p><h3><a href="docs/CDC.pdf">Campus Distance Coordinators Group (CDC)</a></h3> is a system-wide group that is responsible for addressing student, faculty, and staff concerns relating to distance learning at the operational level.  This group helps identify system-wide issues and raises them to the attention of the DLAC.  The CDC is convened and chaired by election from within the CDC membership.</p>
